Predicting Diamond Prices using Linear Regression

Project Objective:
The primary goal of this project was to predict diamond prices based on various features using a linear regression model.

Data Collection and Preparation:
The project utilized a dataset containing information about diamonds, including attributes like carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and depth. The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values and categorical variables were encoded for model compatibility.

Feature Selection and Engineering:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand relationships between features and the target variable (price). Correlation analysis and feature importance techniques were used to select relevant features for the predictive model. Additionally, new features might have been created or derived to improve model performance.

Model Building:
A linear regression model was chosen due to its interpretability and ability to capture linear relationships between predictors and the target. The dataset was split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model's performance.

Model Evaluation:
The model's performance was assessed using various evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and possibly others to determine how well it generalized to unseen data. Visualization techniques might have been used to showcase the model's predictive capabilities.

Results and Conclusion:
The linear regression model successfully predicted diamond prices based on the selected features. The evaluation metrics demonstrated a certain level of accuracy in price prediction. Insights were drawn regarding the significance of different diamond characteristics in determining prices.

Future Considerations:
For future improvements, more advanced models or ensemble techniques could be explored to enhance prediction accuracy. Additionally, gathering more comprehensive data or including additional features might further improve the model's performance.
